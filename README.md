Developed the 𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞 of an 𝗔𝗜-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗯𝗼𝘁 for the 𝗙𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮 (𝗙𝗦𝗦𝗔𝗜).l. 

The architecture leverages a 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 (𝗟𝗟𝗠) to generate contextually accurate responses. Through base LLM model training, we achieved a response accuracy rate of up to 𝟳𝟬%, demonstrating the effectiveness and impact of the chatbot in providing relevant FSSAI-related information.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 :-

• Integrated dynamic databases using 𝗙𝗔𝗜𝗦𝗦 for optimized 𝐬𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 and data retrieval.
• Utilized an architecture built on a 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗟𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 (𝗟𝗟𝗠) to generate accurate responses.
• Achieved a response accuracy rate of up to 𝟳𝟬% through base LLM model training.
• Demonstrated significant impact and potential for improving chatbot performance in future iterations.
